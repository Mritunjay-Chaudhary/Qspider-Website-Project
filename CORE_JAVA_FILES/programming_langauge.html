                       <li><h1>What is a programming language?</h1><br>
                             ➢ It is a medium or language used to instruct the machine or computer to perform specific tasks, <br>
                             known as programming language. <br> <br>
                             • Based on the approach to solving the real-world problem it is as follows <br>
                             a) Object-oriented language <br>
                             b) Procedure-oriented language <br>
                             c) Functional-oriented language <br>
                             d) Logical-oriented language <br>
                             e) Scripting-oriented language <br> <br>
                             • Based on the level of the programming language it is 3 types <br>
                             a) Machine-level programming language / Low-level language <br>
                             b) Mid-level programming language / Assembly level programming language <br>
                             c) High-level programming language <br>
                        </li><br>

                            ➢ The language which is easily readable understandable executable directly by the machine is <br>
                            known as low-level language. It is also known as machine-level language. <br>
                            For, ex – 0,1 (binary language) <br>
                            The disadvantage of low-level language <br>
                            • It is challenging to understand the programmer directly. <br>
                            For ex- 5C is not understand by machine <br>
                        </li> <br>
                         
                        <li><h1>b) Mid-level programming language / Assembly level programming language</h1><br>
                            ➢ The language which having some pre-defined words such as add, sub, mul, div, etc for some <br>
                            specific tasks is known as mid-level. <br>
                            ➢ There are pre-defined words known as Mnemonics. <br> <br>
                            Here, <br>
                             Add word use for addition. <br>
                             Sub word used for subtraction. <br>
                             Mul word used for multiplication. <br> <br>
                            These are pre define words that are not directly understandable by machines. therefore to <br>
                            make machines understandable. where use the translation called to assembly to convert midlevel into machine-level language. <br>
                            For ex- Instruction, the set was used in 8085,8086 architectures. <br> <br>
                              <h3> The disadvantage of mid-level language</h3> <br>
                              • It has limited pre-defined words to do limited tasks. <br>
                              • It does not have a control statement to control the flow of execution. <br>
                              • Such as a looping statement. <br>

                        </li>
                        <li><h1>c) High-level language</h1><br>
                            
                            ➢ The language which is easily readable understandable and easy to instruct the machine by <br>
                            the programmer is known as high-level language. <br>
                            Ex – Java, C, C++, Python, etc. <br> <br>
                            • The high-level programming language is not directly understandable by machines to make <br>
                            machines understandable using the translate called a compiler, interpreters to convert highlevel to low-level language. <br>
                            • Every high-level language has its own compiler interpreter. <br>
                            • A high-level language is used to create some. Applications or software. <br> <br>
                            <h3>The file structure in Windows</h3><br>
                            In Windows hard disk can be divided into multiple portions and each portion is known as a drive. <br>
                            Each drive is represented by one name and colon (:) <br>
                            E.g.- C:, D:, E: <br>
                            The drive consists of some folders. Folders are also known as directories. <br>
                            There are 2 types of folders as follows. <br>
                            I. User home directory <br>
                            II. Current working directory / Working directory <br> <br>
                           <h3> I. User home directory </h3> <br>
                             • The folder/directory created with a “user name” inside the user's directory of C drive <br>
                             is called user home directory. <br>
                             • As soon as we open the command prompt, we are always inside the user home <br>
                             directory <br> <br>
                            <h3>II. Current working directory / Working directory </h3> <br>
                            The folder/directory which is currently in use is known as the current working Directory / <br>
                            Working Directory. <br>
