                        ➢ Java provides some unique features. Such as (P2RIAD2HOMS2). <br>
                        1. Platform-independent language <br>
                        2. Portable <br>
                        3. Robust <br>
                        4. Interpreted <br>
                        5. Architectural Neutral <br>
                        6. Dynamic <br>
                        7. Distributed <br>
                        8. High Performance <br>
                        9. Object-Oriented Programming <br>
                        10. Multi-threading <br>
                        11. Simple <br>

                        <h3> What is a platform? </h3><br>
                        ➢ It is the combination of an operating system and a processor. <br>
                        E.g.- Windows 32-bit, Windows 64-bit, Linux. <br> <br>
                        <h3>What is a bit?</h3> <br>
                        ➢ It is the smallest unit is which measures the data or instructions. <br>
                        • 8 bits make up a byte. <br>
                        • 1024 bytes make up a kilobyte (KB). <br>
                        • 1024 kilobytes make up a megabyte (MB). <br>
                        • 1024 megabytes make up a gigabyte (GB). <br>
                        • 1024 gigabytes make up a terabyte (TB).  <br> <br>
                        <h3> What is platform dependent?</h3><br>
                        • If one application develops one platform after that it can execute on only the same kind of platform <br>
                        dependent. <br>
                        • The application is usually developed by C known as platform dependent. <br> <br>
                       <h3> What is the platform In Dependent?</h3><br>
                         • It is one application developed on one platform and after that, it can be executed on any kind of <br>
                         platform known as platform independent. <br>
                         • The application is usually developed in Java language and is platform-independent. <br> <br>
                         <h3>C is platform Dependent –  </h3> <br>

                          <h3>Java is a platform, Independent </h3><br>
                           photo? <br> <br>
                           
                           <h3>Why Java is platform-independent architecture neutral?</h3> <br>
                           
                           • Java compiler does not convert directly high-level language into low-level language. <br>
                           • It converts high-level language into one intermediate file or class file. Which is known as a class <br>
                           file or byte code file. <br>
                           • Class files are only understandable by the Java interpreter called JVM (Java virtual machine). <br>
                           • Once the class file is generated it can execute on any kind of platform which has JVM on it. <br>
                           • This architecture makes Java platform independent architectural but JVM Dependent. <br> 
                           • By this architecture Java follows WORA (Write one run anywhere) architecture.<br><br>

                           <h3>What is WORA architecture?</h3> <br>
                           • WORA stands for write once run anywhere. This means we can write a program in one platform <br>
                           after compilation of the program we can execute it on any of the platforms which have JVM on it. <br> <br>

                           <h3>Conversion of high-level to low-level in Java</h3> <br>

                             <h4>Compiler</h4><br>
                             ➢ The process of converting Java source file into intermedia file or class file is known as compilation <br>
                             or compiling the program. <br> <br>
                             <h4>Execution or Run</h4> <br>
                             ➢ The process of converting an intermediate file or class file into machine-understandable language <br>
                             is known as execution or running the program. <br> <br>
                             <h4>Java source file</h4> <br>
                             ➢ The file which is written by the programmer in Java language and saved with Java extension is <br>
                             known as a Java source file. <br> <br>
                             <h4>What is a class file</h4> <br>
                             ➢ The file which is created by the Java compiler after successful compilation is known as a class file <br>
                             or byte code file or intermediate file. The extension of the class file is .class. <br>
                             What is the name of the Java compiler? <br>
                              Ans – Javac <br>
                             What is the name of the Java interpreter? <br>
                             Ans – JVM (Java virtual machine) <br> <br>
                             <h4>Types of Error -</h4> <br>
                            ➢ It is three types <br>
                            1. Compile time error <br>
                            2. Execution error / Run time error / Exception error <br>
                            3. Logical error <br> <br>
                            <h4>1. Compile time error </h4><br>
                            The time of compiling the program. If we are getting some error because of syntax error are <br>
                            saying that compile time error. <br>
                            E.g. – Semicolon (;) expected possible lossy conversion from double to int. SOPER (a), can’t find <br>
                            symbols ’ a ’. <br> <br>
                           
                            <h4>Syntax –</h4> <br>
                            The Grammer and the rule we are using in the programming is known as syntax. <br> <br>
                            <h4>2. Execution error / Run time error / Exception error</h4> <br>
                            The time of execution of the program. If we are getting the same error is known as a run <br>
                            time/execution time error. <br>
                            Ex – <br>
                            1. FileNotFounException <br>
                            2. ArithmaticException <br>
                            3. StackOverFlowError <br>
                            4. OutOfMemoryError <br> <br>
                            <h4>3. Logical error</h4> <br>
                            If in the program there is no compile time error as well as No run time error but after getting the <br>
                            output it not matching with the expected output. This type of error is known as logical error. <br>
                            Example – If the program requirement is to find out the sum of 5 and 7. And after writing the <br>
                            program there is no compile time error. As well as run output as a 35, when our expected output <br>
                            is 12. This is nothing but a logical error. <br>
